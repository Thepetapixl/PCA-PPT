# PCA-PPT
In order to reduce the dimensionality of huge data sets, a technique known as principal component analysis, or PCA, is frequently utilized. PCA works by condensing a large collection of variables into a smaller set that still retains the majority of the data in the larger set. However, accuracy inevitably suffers when a data set's variable count is reduced. In order to reduce the number of dimensions, one must compromise some accuracy for simplicity. Smaller data sets are easier to examine and display, and since there are fewer unnecessary variables to handle, machine learning algorithms can analyze data much more quickly and easily.
